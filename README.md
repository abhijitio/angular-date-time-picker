# angular-date-time-picker

It is pure AngularJS based Date-Time picker, no jQuery. 

You can select date and time. 

It contains the current date to next one year calendar. Where, in the ongoing month, it will display present date to end date of the month. 

Past dates will not display. 

You can change the months by clicking on left-right arrow.

After selecting Date, it will land up to pick time. Time slots can be added manually in the code as per choice. 

It is real time based intelligence solution. You can not pick the past time slots, you can only choose next availble slots. 

As an example, 

Suppose you are selecting time at 4 PM, then 3 PM time slot will not show, you can only choose the time after 4 PM. 

It is useful for booking services. 

I created this project when I was working at LocalOye (A hyperlocal based Indian startup https://localoye.com/)
